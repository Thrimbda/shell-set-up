# shell-set-up

my personal shell set up script.

it's basically a customed adaptation of **[oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)** install script.

usage:

```bash
# via curl
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thrimbda/shell-set-up/master/install.sh)"

# via wget
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thrimbda/shell-set-up/master/install.sh -O -)"
```

if you want to adopt my configuration, please replace `DEFAULT_USER` variable in `.zshrc`.

~~maybe someday I'd update it and make this one configurable.~~
